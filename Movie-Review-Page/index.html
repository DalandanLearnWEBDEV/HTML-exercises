        <p>The Maze Runner movie posters typically feature the main characters, led by Thomas, running frantically
            through the towering, vine-covered stone walls of a vast, ominous maze, emphasizing action, mystery, and
            the
            central challenge of escape, with the title often stylized to look like maze structures and taglines
            like
            "Get ready to run" hinting at the dystopian survival theme
        </p>

        <p><strong>Movie Rating:</strong><span aria-hidden="true">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆</span> (6.8/10)</p>
